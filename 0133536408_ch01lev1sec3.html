<P class="docText">Thus far we have mentioned the term <span class="docEmphasis">model</span> a number of times, and you probably have a vague notion of what we mean by model. The following definition of a model is from the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms:</P>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">"A mathematical or physical system, obeying certain specified conditions, whose behavior is used to understand a physical, biological, or social system to which it is analogous in some way."</p></blockquote>
<P class="docText">In this textbook, model will be taken to mean <span class="docEmphasis">mathematical model</span>. More specifically, we develop process models. A working definition of process model is</P>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText">a set of equations (including the necessary input data to solve the equations) that allows us to predict the behavior of a chemical process.</p></blockquote>
<P class="docText">Models play a very important role in control-system design. Models can be used to simulate expected process behavior with a proposed control system. Also, models are often "embedded" in the controller itself; in effect the controller can use a process model to anticipate the effect of a control action. We can see from <A class="docLink" HREF="0133536408_ch01lev1sec1.html#ch01lev2sec1">Example 1.1</A> that we at least need to know whether an increase in the flow rate will increase or decrease the tank level. For example, an increase in the inlet flow rate increases the tank level (positive gain), while an increase in the outlet flow rate leads to a decrease in the tank level (negative gain). In order to design a controller, then, we need to know whether an increase in the manipulated input increases or decreases the process output variable; that is, we need to know whether the process gain is positive or negative.</P>
<P class="docText">An example of a process model is shown next. A number of other examples are developed in <A class="docLink" HREF="0133536408_ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</A>.</P>
<A NAME="ch01lev2sec7"></A><H4 class="docSection2Title"> Example 1.3: Liquid Surge Vessel Model</H4>
<P class="docText">In the development of a dynamic model, simplifying assumptions are often made. Also, the model requirements are a function of the end-use of the model. In this case, we are ultimately interested in designing a controller and in simulating control-system behavior. Since we have not covered control algorithms in depth, our <span class="docEmphasis">objective</span> here is to develop a model that relates the inputs (manipulated and disturbance) to measured outputs that we wish to regulate.</P>
<P class="docText">For this process, we first assume that the density is constant. The model we develop should allow us to determine how the volume of liquid in the vessel varies as a function of the inlet and outlet flow rates. We will list the <span class="docEmphasis">state variables</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">parameters</span>, and the <span class="docEmphasis">input</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">output variables</span>. We must also specify the required information to solve this problem (see <A class="docLink" HREF="0133536408_ch01lev1sec1.html#ch01fig02">Figure 1-2</A>). The system is the liquid in the tank and the liquid surface is the top boundary of the system. The following notation is used in the modeling equations:</P>

<P class="docText">Notice the implicit assumption that the density of fluid in the vessel does not depend on position (the perfect mixing assumption). This assumption allows an ordinary differential equation (ODE) formulation. We refer to any system that can be modeled by ODEs as <span class="docEmphasis">lumped parameter systems</span>. Also notice that the outlet stream density was assumed to be equal to the density of fluid in the tank. Assuming that the density of the inlet stream and fluid in the vessel are equal, this equation is then reduced to<sup class="docFootnote"><A class="docLink" HREF="#ch01fn01">[1]</A></sup></P><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><A NAME="ch01fn01">[1]</A></sup> It might be tempting to the reader to begin to directly write a "volume balance" expression, which looks similar to Equation (<A class="docLink" HREF="#ch01equ03">1.3</A>). We wish to make it clear that there is no such thing as a volume balance and  Equation (<A class="docLink" HREF="#ch01equ03">1.3</A>) is only correct because of the constant density assumption. It is a good idea to always write a mass balance expression, such as Equation (<A class="docLink" HREF="#ch01equ02">1.2</A>), before making assumptions about the fluid density, which may lead to Equation (<A class="docLink" HREF="#ch01equ03">1.3</A>).</p></blockquote>

<P class="docText"><A class="docLink" HREF="#ch01lev2sec7">Example 1.3</A> provides an introduction to the notion of states, inputs, and parameters. Consider now the notion of an output. We may consider fluid volume to be a desired output that we wish to control, for example. In that case, volume would not only be a state, it would also be considered an output. On the other hand, we may be concerned about fluid height, rather than volume. Volume and height are related through the constant cross-sectional area, <span class="docEmphasis">A</span></P>

<P class="docText">where fluid height is now the state variable. It should also be noted that inputs can be classified as either <span class="docEmphasis">manipulated</span> inputs (that we may regulate with a control valve, for example) or <span class="docEmphasis">disturbance</span> inputs. If we desired to measure fluid height and manipulate the flow rate of stream 1, for example, then <span class="docEmphasis">F</span><SUB>1</SUB> would be a manipulated input, while <span class="docEmphasis">F</span><SUB>2</SUB> would be a disturbance input.</P>
<P class="docText">We have found that a single process can have different modeling equations and variables, depending on assumptions and the objectives used when developing the model.</P>
<P class="docText">The liquid level process is an example of an <span class="docEmphasis">integrating</span> process. If the process is initially at steady state, the inlet and outlet flow rates are equal (see Equation <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch01equ03">1.3</A> or <A class="docLink" HREF="#ch01equ07">1.7</A>). If the inlet flow rate is suddenly increased while the outlet flow rate remains constant, the liquid level (volume) will increase until the vessel overflows. Similarly, if the outlet flow rate is increased while the inlet flow rate remains constant, the tank level will decrease until the vessel is empty.</P>
<P class="docText">In this textbook we first develop process models based on <span class="docEmphasis">fundamental</span> or first-principles analysis, that is, models that are based on known physical-chemical relationships, such as material and energy balances, as well as reaction kinetics, transport phenomena, and thermodynamic relationships. We then develop <span class="docEmphasis">empirical</span> models. An empirical model is usually developed based on applying input changes to a process and observing the response of measured outputs. Model parameters are adjusted so that the model outputs match the observed process outputs. This technique is particularly useful for developing models that can be used for controller design.</P>
