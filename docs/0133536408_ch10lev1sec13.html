A spectroscopic ellipsometer is available to measure the growth rate of this film. The growth rate is a function of the composition [mole fraction of TMG (trimethyl gallium)] of the inlet feed stream. The composition of the inlet feed stream is a function of the flow rate of hydrogen that bubbles through a bottle of TMG.</P>

The temperature is regulated by the pressure of the steam in the reboiler, which is a function of the steam flow to the reboiler. Show the proper signals for a cascade type of control system.

The catalytic reforming unit produces roughly 25% of the gasoline produced by the refinery. The throughput of the unit is 25,000 barrels per day (Bbl/day) and the value is roughly $30/Bbl. The gross operating income of the unit is then roughly $1 million/day. You feel certain that tighter control can improve the yield of the unit, increase the value of the product, and reduce operating costs. The reforming unit consists of three fuel gas-fired furnaces and three catalytic reactors with a number of additional heat exchangers and separation columns. You feel that you must prove that advanced control can work on part of the process before you attempt to implement it on the entire process. You decide that the place to start is on the temperature control of the process fluid leaving the first furnace.</P>
<P class="docText">A simplified process instrumentation diagram for the furnace that heats the process stream for the first reactor is shown in <A class="docLink" HREF="0133536408_ch10lev1sec2.html#ch10fig01">Figure 10-1</A>. The "old school" operations personnel have been controlling the outlet temperature of the process stream by simply manipulating the fuel gas valve directly. You realize that this method allows fuel gas header pressure changes to affect the fuel gas flow rate, which will affect the process fluid outlet temperature.</P>
<P class="docText">You wish to show the benefits of <span class="docEmphasis">cascade control</span> for this system.
